The buttons use our primary colour to keep a harmony within the website. Each button will be placed in a specific spot to interact with the environment that its placed in.

- The regular buttons are going to be used for cards, and forms.
- The light buttons are for areas where the background is darker than usual.
- The ghost buttons are going to be used on the banner.
